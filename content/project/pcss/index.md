This report was prepared for **decision makers and policy makers in the provincial government** to support goals of increasing active transportation while striving for **Vision Zero**. It uses linked datasets encompassing **insurance claims, police reports, hospital admissions, and sociodemographic information** to describe changes in road traffic injury rates over time, identify population groups with higher rates, and discern factors that influence injury severity.

**Key findings:**
- Insurance claims miss **just over 25%** of injuries requiring hospital admission for pedestrians, cyclists, and drivers.
- **Falls on public roadways** (including sidewalks) are an important and increasing source of injuries for pedestrians and cyclists but are not captured by auto-insurance claims or police collision data.
- **Cyclists and pedestrians** face a disproportionately higher risk of injury and death compared to motor vehicle occupants. Reductions over time are primarily from fewer motor-vehicle collisions, while **pedestrian falls and single-bicycle crashes are increasing**.
- **Inequalities** exist: lower-income individuals and those in less wealthy neighborhoods face higher injury rates; **older age** is associated with a higher proportion of fall-related traffic injuries.
- **Speed limits >30 km/hr** and **heavier vehicles** are associated with higher risk of fatal injury for all road users, with a greater effect on pedestrians and cyclists.

**Considerations:**
- Stratify road safety goals by **road user type, population groups, and crash types**.
- Expand the definition of **pedestrian injuries to include falls on roadways** (including sidewalks).
- Manage kinetic energy via **speed management and physical separation** as part of a **Safe Systems** approach.
- A **provincial travel survey** is needed to accurately assess pedestrian and cyclist risk.
- Improve **emergency department data collection** on mechanisms of injury (including minor injuries) to enhance surveillance, risk-factor analysis, and severity assessment.
