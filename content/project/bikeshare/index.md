This project evaluated how implementing **public bicycle share programs (PBSPs)** affected the likelihood of **bicycling collisions** across multiple North American cities. Using a **difference-in-differences** approach applied to repeated cross-sectional survey data, it shows that crash odds **did not increase after PBSP implementation** and were notably **lower in cities with existing programs**, supporting the safety of well-established bike share systems.

**Impact:** Offers empirical insights to urban planners and policymakers assessing the safety implications of bike share adoption.

**Tech Stack:** R, quasi-experimental design (difference-in-differences), multi-city survey analysis
