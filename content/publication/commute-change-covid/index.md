abstract: "Transportation shifts in Canada precipitated by COVID-19 may persist into recovery. We examined commuters in a national survey (Canadian Perspectives Survey Series 3) and commute changes attributed to COVID-19 risk. We modeled associations of changing commute with pre-COVID-19 mode, adjusting for coarse socio-demographic covariates. We found that all out-of-home commute modes declined during COVID-19, with increases in telework. Commuting by public transit was most strongly associated with change in commute mode to avoid COVID-19 risk. Among pre-COVID-19 transit commuters, 18.2% continue to rely on transit, and personal motor vehicle use is more common (13.0%) than walking (3.4%) or cycling (2.9%)."
