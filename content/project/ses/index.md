This project maps how **social inequalities** shape the risk of **road traffic injuries** across neighborhoods in British Columbia. By combining census data, crash records, and spatial modeling, it highlights patterns of deprivation and injury risk—especially for **pedestrians and cyclists**—to inform safer and more equitable urban planning.  

**Impact:** Provides evidence of strong socioeconomic gradient across all regions of the province, a first step to creating and evaluating equitable **transportation safety policies**.  

**Tech Stack:** R (INLA, tidyverse, sf), GIS, Bayesian spatial modeling
